<h2>Heedong이는 누구인가?</h2>
<p>
<video src="hd.mp4"controls></video><br>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/jung_heedong/" target="_blank"title="heedong's instagram">Heedong</a> is a male maltese born in year 2016 august 18th. In the video, heedong is the pup with number 2 on his back.
He's been living with us from 50 days old. We took him from his mothers house.
Though heedong was quite big compared to his siblings,He was so small. When we first met him, he was only the size of my hands. Fur like a dandelions seed.
We made a home at the living room. There was this little house made of cotton fiber for him but he used to sleep on the toilet pad I don't know why.
The door was open nearly always but he didn't come out and gave us this 'are you going to leave me here' look.
Then we had no choice but to take him out of there and put him on our laps.
<p style="margin-top:40px;">We hope that he'll be with us for a long time, in good health. Be with us until you are more than 20 years old!
